### Introduction 
A simple project turning out-of-service smoke detectors into something new such as guitar pedals or pickups, sensor gadgets or other simple devices.

#### Piezo-based guitar pickup

Me and my best friend [Hallmar Gauti](https://github.com/hallmar) worked on making a simple piezo-based pickup and pre-amplifier for acoustic guitars and other string instruments. One of the main reasons for this is that piezos are one of the main components in smoke detectors (they make the noise and have to be very [reliable](https://web.archive.org/web/20100822192559/http://www.fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire07/art063.html) and [standardized](https://web.archive.org/web/20130520093208/http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/Standards.aspx?param=6055&title=Fire%20detection%20and%20fire%20alarm%20systems)).
