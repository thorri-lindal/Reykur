### Introduction 
A simple project turning out-of-service smoke detectors into something new such as guitar pedals or pickups, sensor gadgets or other simple devices.

#### Piezo-based guitar pickup

Me and my best friend [Hallmar Gauti](https://github.com/hallmar) worked on making a simple piezo-based pickup and pre-amplifier for acoustic guitars and other string instruments. One of the main reasons for this is that piezos are one of the main components in smoke detectors (they make the noise and have to be very [reliable](https://web.archive.org/web/20100822192559/http://www.fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire07/art063.html) and [standardized](https://web.archive.org/web/20130520093208/http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/Standards.aspx?param=6055&title=Fire%20detection%20and%20fire%20alarm%20systems)). Next step is measuring the _total harmonic distortion_ and frequency response of the piezo pickup, most likely using Arduino + Numpy and Matplotlib (just for the practice).

#### Ionization Chamber
Use the ionization chamber for a µcontroller-based smoke sensor for applications.

#### Infrared light, Lens and photoelectric receiver
Perfect use for parts in a DIY project.

#### DIY Cloud Chamber (for educational purposes)
Could be a fun and informative project to teach people about [cloud chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber) using the americium-241.

#### Eurorack Module using Americium-241
Test out a circuit that uses Americium-241 (and a geiger module) to make a random seed generator eurorack module.
